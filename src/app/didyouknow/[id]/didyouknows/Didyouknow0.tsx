        Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are genetic disorders that result in the inability of the body to properly metabolize nutrients. These diseases involve failure of the metabolic pathways involved in either the break-down or storage of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins. Treatment for IEM varies depending on the specific disorder but may involve dietary changes, enzyme replacement therapy, or gene therapy.
